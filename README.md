Hello I'm Irian, a web and mobile app developer. I wanted to learn a new tool specially built for static websites since I've always been developing in React, which is meant for just the opposite.

So I found Astro and I built my personal portfolio website, as you can see in this repository.

You can visit it at [irian.codes](http://irian.codes) and if you like and think we could work together let's chat! Here are my socials:

## If you are a developer

Hello fellow dev! ðŸ‘‹
